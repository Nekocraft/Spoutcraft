Spoutcraft
==========
Spoutcraft is a Minecraft client mod and launcher that provides users with a simple and more customizable Minecraft experience. Servers running SpoutPlugin push content to Spoutcraft users as needed; such as custom items, blocks, and user skins, capes, and other accessories. Players can then enjoy custom server experiences without having to manually modify their client for each server.
